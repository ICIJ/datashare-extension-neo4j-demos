    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial will help you replicate some of the explorations made in the second part of the [Datashare's Neo4j Plugin Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOQSGpjBMS0), where [Bloom](https://neo4j.com/product/bloom/) and Neo4j [Graph Data Science](https://neo4j.com/product/graph-data-science/) are used together to explore the [Enron email corpus](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~enron/).\n",
    "\n",
    "The Enron email corpus is a large dataset of emails released for research purposes after the [Enron company collapsed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enron_scandal) in the early 2000's following a wide-spread use of fraudulent accounting techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "The video tutorial showcases how to combine Bloom's powerful UI together with Graph Data Science, to quickly gain knowledge about the graph created from Datashare using the Neo4j plugin.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the Enron email corpus is **quite large** so adding documents to Datashare, extracting named entities and creating the graph from Datashare will potentially take **very long** (we will try to provide you with a neo4j dump to gain time in the future).\n",
    "\n",
    "**This notebook is meant to be followed side by side with the [tutorial video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOQSGpjBMS0)**. Following it step-by-step with the video, you'll be able to perform Cypher queries in order to update your graph and perform the same explorations as in the tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some of the exploration, you will perform in order to explore this data.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll use [centrality algorithms](https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/algorithms/centrality/) to identify employees centralizing information at Enron.\n",
